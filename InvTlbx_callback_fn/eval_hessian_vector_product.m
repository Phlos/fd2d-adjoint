function [Hv] = eval_hessian_vector_product(m, v, usr_par)
% EVAL_HESSIAN_VECTOR_PRODUCT function to compute Hessian-vector products.
%
% Input:
% m : model
% v : vector to which the Hessian should be applied (must have same size as
% m)
% usr_par : auxiliary user defined parameters (optional)
%
% Output:
% Hv : Hessian-vector-product which must have the same size as m and v.
